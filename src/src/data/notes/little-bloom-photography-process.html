      My goal is to make your session stress-free, joyful, and meaningful. Here's what you can expect when we work together:

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">1. Let's Connect</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          It all starts with a chat. You can reach out through my website or email me directly at hello@littlebloomphotography.com. We'll talk about the type of session you'd like, whether it is family, maternity, couples, or milestones, and what matters most to you. This helps me get to know your story so I can capture it in a way that feels true to you.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">2. Planning Made Simple</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Once your session is booked, I'll guide you through the details. I'll share outfit tips, location ideas, and suggestions for personal touches. The day before, I'll send a friendly reminder and make sure you feel fully prepared.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          This is where the magic happens. My style is natural and laid-back. I'll give light direction when needed, but I love letting laughter, connection, and those in-between moments shine.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">4. Your Gallery</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Within one week, you'll receive a full gallery of edited, high-resolution images. There are no hidden fees and no limits. Every memory we captured will be yours to keep.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">5. Memories That Last</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          From downloads to prints and albums, your photos are meant to be lived with and shared, not just stored away. My hope is that they become keepsakes you'll treasure for years to come.

        And hopefully, this won't be the only time we work together. I'd love to capture more of your story as it continues, from new milestones to new seasons of life.

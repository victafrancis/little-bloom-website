    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      The best way to set kids up for success is to make the session feel like playtime, not picture day. Bring along a few favorite snacks, small toys, or even a special game that helps them relax and enjoy themselves. Short breaks during the session are always welcome — sometimes a quick snack or silly game can reset the mood and bring back the smiles.

      Parents often worry that their child won't sit still, smile on cue, or "behave" for the camera. Here's the secret: those aren't the photos we're chasing. Some of the most beautiful images come from the candid moments — giggles, curious glances, or even a goofy expression that shows off their personality.

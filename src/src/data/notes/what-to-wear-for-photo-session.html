      Choosing outfits for a photo session can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. With just a little planning, you can look and feel amazing while making sure your photos come out timeless and cohesive. The goal isn't perfection, it's creating a look that feels natural and true to your family.

      Coordinate, Don't Match
    </h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      One of the biggest misconceptions about family photos is that everyone needs to wear the exact same thing. Matching outfits can actually look stiff and dated. Instead, aim for color coordination. Pick a color palette of 2–3 main colors with one or two neutral tones to tie everything together. For example: soft blues, cream, and beige. Each family member can wear something within that palette, in their own style. This creates harmony without looking too "uniform."

      Keep Prints Simple
    </h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Strong or bold prints often become too "catchy" in an image and can become distracting - we aim to focus on the face and not the prints.

      Comfort Over Perfection
    </h2>
    
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable. If you're constantly adjusting an outfit, it will show in your photos. Choose clothes that move with you, flatter your body, and reflect your personality. When you feel good, it's easier to relax, have fun, and let authentic moments shine. For kids and babies, comfort is even more important. If they feel itchy, restricted, or cranky in their outfit, it will be harder for them (and you) to enjoy the session.

        At the end of the day, the focus of your photos isn't the outfits — it's the love and connection you share. Outfits simply help complement that story.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Your maternity journey is a milestone worth remembering. These photographs become a tangible reminder of the love and strength that carried you through. Years from now, you'll look back and treasure the beauty of this season, not just the bump but also the emotions that came with it.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">When to Book</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          The ideal time for maternity sessions is usually between 28 and 32 weeks.<br />
          By this stage, your bump is beautifully visible but you are still comfortable enough to move, pose, and enjoy the session.<br />
          Every pregnancy is unique, so if you are showing earlier or carrying multiples, we can always adjust the timeline to fit you best.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">Solo or With Loved Ones?</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Your maternity photos can be all about you. You can also choose to include your partner, children, or even a beloved pet. Including family members adds another layer to your story, capturing the excitement and connection as everyone awaits the new arrival. Both approaches are special, and we will tailor the session to reflect your vision.

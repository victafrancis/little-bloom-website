  </h1>

      Pregnancy is a season like no other. The weeks may sometimes feel long, but the months pass by quickly, and before you know it, your little one is in your arms. Maternity photography is a way to pause and celebrate this incredible chapter, preserving the glow, anticipation, and love that surrounds it.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mb-4 mt-8">Why Maternity Photos Matter</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Your maternity journey is a milestone worth remembering, these photographs become a tangible reminder of the love and strength that carried you through. Years from now, you'll look back and treasure the beauty of this season — not just the bump, but the emotions that came with it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mb-4 mt-8">When to Book</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      The ideal time for maternity sessions is usually between 28–34 weeks. By this stage, your bump is beautifully visible but you're still comfortable enough to move, pose, and enjoy the session. Every pregnancy is unique, so if you're showing earlier or carrying multiples, we can always adjust the timeline to fit you best.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-light mb-4 mt-8">Solo or With Loved Ones?</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Your maternity photos can be all about you. But you can also choose to include your partner, children, or even a beloved pet. Including family members adds another layer to your story, capturing the excitement and connection as everyone awaits the new arrival. Both approaches are special, and we'll tailor the session to reflect your vision.

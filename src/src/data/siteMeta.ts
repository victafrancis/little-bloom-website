    description: "Hello, I am Ayi, I am glad you are here! Photography has always been my passion. I picked up my first camera over 20 years ago, not knowing it would become such a big part of my creative side. Through the years, I’ve captured many stories, but the one that changed everything was my own: becoming a mom."

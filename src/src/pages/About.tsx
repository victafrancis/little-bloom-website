                    I picked up my first camera over 20 years ago, not knowing it would become such a big part of my creative side. Through the years, I’ve captured many stories, but the one that changed everything was my own: becoming a mom.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    When my firstborn arrived, I began to see the world through a new lens, one filled with wonder, gratitude, and an awareness of just how quickly life moves. Every smile, every milestone, every tiny moment feels like a precious bloom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s how <b>Little Bloom Photography</b> came to life. It’s more than a name, it’s a promise to treat your story with the same care and love I give to my own.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">A Little Bit More About Me</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When I’m not behind the camera, you’ll usually find me having a warm cup of coffee (or matcha latte), cooking, spending time with my family, or getting lost in a good K-drama. I also love exploring hidden gems at thrift / vintage shops.
              </p>
              <p>
                People who know me say I’m a little “extra”, and honestly, I take that as a compliment! :) It means you can trust that I’ll pour my whole heart and soul into your session.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">My Approach</h2>
              <p>
                I believe the best photos are never forced. Forget stiff poses and awkward smiles, my sessions are about having fun, letting go, and allowing your family’s story to shine through naturally.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="py-6 px-4 rounded-lg">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-4">What You Can Expect</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Working with me feels less like a photoshoot and more like spending time with a friend. I’ll guide you when you need it, but I’ll also step back and let the natural magic happen. My goal is to make the experience stress-free from start to finish.
              </p>
              <p>
                And when it’s all done? You’ll receive a <b>full</b> gallery of edited, high-resolution photos — no limits, no extra charges for more photos. Because every single memory deserves to be yours.

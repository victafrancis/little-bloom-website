    What to Wear for Your Photo Session
  </h1>

    <p class="mb-6 px-6 leading-relaxed">
      Choosing outfits for a photo session can feel overwhelming, but it does not have to be. With just a little planning, you can look and feel amazing while making sure your photos come out timeless and cohesive. The goal is not perfection. It is creating a look that feels natural and true to your family.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">Coordinate, Not Match</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          One of the biggest misconceptions about family photos is that everyone needs to wear the exact same thing. Matching outfits can actually look stiff and dated. Instead, aim for color coordination. Pick a color palette of two or three main colors with one or two neutral tones to tie everything together. For example, soft blues, cream, and beige. Each family member can wear something within that palette in their own style. This creates harmony without looking too uniform.

          Your outfits should reflect the season of your session:

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-mustard">Spring</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">
              Light and airy colors such as pastel pinks, soft blues, whites, and florals. Dresses, skirts, and lightweight shirts work beautifully.

            <p class="text-sm">
              Breezy and balanced with soft yellows, sage greens, denim, or linen neutrals.

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-mustard">Fall</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">
              Warm and cozy with earthy tones such as burnt orange, mustard, olive green, and burgundy. Chunky sweaters, scarves, and boots are perfect.

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-mustard">Winter</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">
              Classic and timeless with deep tones like navy, emerald, or maroon, paired with neutrals such as gray, cream, or black. Layers like coats and knits add beautiful texture.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">Keep Prints Simple</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Strong or bold prints often take too much attention in a photo and can distract from the focus of the image. The goal is to highlight your expressions and connection, not the clothing.

      <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-mustard px-6 py-3 rounded-r-lg">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">Comfort Over Perfection</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable. If you are constantly adjusting an outfit, it will show in your photos. Choose clothes that move with you, flatter your body, and reflect your personality. When you feel good, it is easier to relax, have fun, and let authentic moments shine. For kids and babies, comfort is even more important. If they feel itchy, restricted, or cranky in their outfit, it will be harder for them and for you to enjoy the session.

          At the end of the day, the focus of your photos is not the outfits. It is the love and connection you share. Outfits simply help complement that story. If you are still unsure what to wear, do not stress. I am always happy to help with suggestions, inspiration boards, or even quick feedback on outfit photos you are considering.

      My goal is to make your session stress-free, joyful, and meaningful. Here's what you can expect when we work together:

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">1. Let's Connect</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          It all starts with a chat. You can reach out through <a href="/contact" class="text-mustard hover:text-sage transition-colors">my website</a> or email me directly at <a href="mailto:hello@littlebloomphotography.com" class="text-mustard hover:text-sage transition-colors" aria-label="Email hello@littlebloomphotography.com">hello@littlebloomphotography.com</a>. We'll talk about the type of session you'd like, whether it is family, maternity, couples, or milestones, and what matters most to you. This helps me get to know your story so I can capture it in a way that feels true to you.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-heavy mb-3 text-mustard">2. Planning Made Simple</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Once your session is booked, I'll guide you through the details. I'll share outfit tips, location ideas, and suggestions for personal touches. The day before, I'll send a friendly reminder and make sure you feel fully prepared.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          This is where the magic happens. My style is natural and laid-back. I'll give light direction when needed, but I love letting laughter, connection, and those in-between moments shine.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Within one week, you'll receive a full gallery of edited, high-resolution images. There are no hidden fees and no limits. Every memory we captured will be yours to keep.

        And hopefully, this won’t be the only time we work together. I’d love the chance to keep telling your story as it grows, through every milestone and new season ahead.
